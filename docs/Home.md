## What is Ether.Network ?

Ether.Network is a C# networking library. It allows you to create simple and fast client or server applications very easily.

Ether.Network provides you everthing you need to build your own client and server applications. Like a client manager, built-in packets, etc...

These are the main classes you will need to build a client or server :

- [NetServer][netserver]
- [NetClient][netclient] 
- [NetConnection][netconnection]
- [NetPacketBase][netpacketbase]
- [NetPacket][netpacket]

[netconnection]: NetConnection
[netclient]: NetClient
[netserver]: NetServer
[netpacketbase]: NetPacketBase
[netpacket]: NetPacket
