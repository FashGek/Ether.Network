Ether.Network is a basic library to make quickly a simple server or client using sockets.

This library is coded in C# using .NET Core framework to target Windows and Linux operating systems.

For now we use the basic synchronous sockets, and in the future we'll add the support of asynchronous sockets to increase performances and stability.
